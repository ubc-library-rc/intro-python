## Outline

### Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to **begin** to understand and use Python. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using Python. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Python takes practice.

This is your session. If you have a question or feel we are going too fast, please let the instructor know. We can decide as a group what to cover.

### Learning Goals

* Understand the basic commands of Python and how to use SYZYGY environment

* Learn the basic data structures available on Python

* Learn how to load, preprocess, and explore data

* Explore two practical (and more advanced) problems
