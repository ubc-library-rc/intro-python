## Introduction to Python for Data Analysis

Do you want to learn about Python but don't know where to start? This workshop is for you! Python is a popular free software program used for several data analysis tasks in both the humanities and sciences. Many state-of-the-art data science courses use Python and it is a programming language in high demand. This introductory level workshop discusses basic commands of the programming language, how to manipulate core data structures and common tasks as data processing.


This workshop is designed for **beginners** who have no or little experience in Python and with opportunities for hands-on experience with sample data. Join us for this workshop and start your data analysis with Python!

### Pre-workshop setup 

Please bring a laptop for the workshop. You **don't** need to have Python installed. We will use an online platform to easy burdens of environment setup. 

1. Make sure that you have a [ubc.syzygy.ca](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) account

    * You will need a CWL login to access syzygy


1. Download the data for this workshop and save it in a folder of your preference

    * Data is available [here](https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/intro-python/raw/master/data.rar). You have to extract the files from `data.rar`

        * You might need to install [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) to decompress the data [Windows users]

* **Alternatively**, you can try to [install the Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) on your personal laptop. 

    * This might be more challenging and the course material or instructors do not guarantee support with problems in your local environment

    * You can find setup instructions [here](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/setup_instructions/setup_instructions/)
